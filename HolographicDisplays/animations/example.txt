Speed: 20
This is an example.
This line will change every 2 seconds...
because it's an animation.
You just have to put "{animation: example.txt}" in a hologram...
to see this animated text.
Each unit of speed will result in a 0.1 seconds delay...
for example 20 * 0.1 = 2 seconds, like in this example.
The fastest animation has speed 1, every 0.1 seconds.
